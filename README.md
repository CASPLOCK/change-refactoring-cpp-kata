## Overview

This kata complements [Clean Code: Fundamentals, Ep. 2 - Names++](https://cleancoders.com/episode/clean-code-episode-2).

## Instructions

The goal of this kata is to refactor the `ChangeItForMe` class methods for
better variable names, structure, and readability. You cannot change the
signatures of the class methods or tests.

## Usage

You can import this project into [Replit](https://replit.com), and it will
handle all dependencies automatically.

If using CLion, be sure to download GTest using the instructions below. It will be installed automatically by CMake when you run the tests.

* [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org)
* [GTest](https://github.com/google/googletest)

To install GTest, download the zip from this link and put it in your Downloads folder. You do not need to unzip it:
